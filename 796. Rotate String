Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false

CODE:
class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
        if(goal.size()!=s.size())
            return false;
        string s1=s+s;
        return s1.find(goal)!=string::npos;
    }
};
