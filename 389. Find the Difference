You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int n=s.size();
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        sort(t.begin(),t.end());
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if (s[i]!=t[i]) return t[i];
        }
        return t[n];
    }
};
