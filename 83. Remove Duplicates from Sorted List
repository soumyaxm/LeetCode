Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. 
Return the linked list sorted as well.

Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* curr = head;
        while (curr != nullptr && curr->next != nullptr) {
            if (curr->val == curr->next->val) {
                ListNode* temp = curr->next;
                curr->next = temp->next;
                delete temp;
            } else {
                curr = curr->next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
};
