Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1.
The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head){
        int n=0;
        while(head!=nullptr) {
            n = (n << 1) | head->val;
            ++head;
        }
        return n;
    }
};
