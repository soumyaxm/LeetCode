Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) {
            return 0;
        }
        int left=minDepth(root->left);
        int right=minDepth(root->right);
        return (left==0 || right==0) ? left+right+1 : min(left,right)+1;
    }
};
