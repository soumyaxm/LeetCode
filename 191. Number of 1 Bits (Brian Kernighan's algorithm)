Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
     int count =0;
     while(n)
      {
       n&=(n-1);
       count++;
      }
    return count;          
    }
};
